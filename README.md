# ðŸŽ® BoyBoy

**boyboy** is a work-in-progress **Game Boy emulator** written in C++.

## ðŸš§ Project status

Currently **paused**. Development may resume in the future, but for now no active work is being done.

## âœ¨ Vision

The long-term goal of **BoyBoy** was to:

- Emulate the original Game Boy hardware (CPU, memory, graphics, sound)  
- Run commercial and homebrew ROMs  
- Provide a simple interface for debugging and testing  

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

To build **boyboy**, the following libraries are required:

- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) â€“ For windowing and input  
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) â€“ For OpenGL extension loading  
- OpenGL â€“ For rendering graphics  

On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu), you can install them with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libglew-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev
```

Make sure you have **CMake 3.27+** and a C++23 compiler.

## ðŸ›  Build instructions
